1.  It is easy to understand what you want to research, furthermore you use a lot of figures and widget to show your interactive results which makes you automatically spend more time on the project, thus also understanding the research.

2.  The hardest part is the boxplot section, there is a lot of information summed up in two figures.

3.  Your proxy for inflation, you use CPI as a proxy for inflation this is not documented.

4.  Improvements.

4a. More boxplots. Showing all six boxplots would make it both faster and easier to understand the point, more importantly comparing the plots is also eaiser.
4b. Descriptive part; in Denmark the Inflation is from 1900 but all other variables start at 1960, you could adjust either variable(s) to avoid confusion.
4c. Describing why you use CPI as proxy for inflation.

5.  A way to extent the analysis is to see if it is possible to forecast inflation based on information from previous periods, or you could try to run a regression maybe with more variables to try to explain the effects.
